In the learning path of a functional programmer, probably the simplest typeclass we get to learn is the _Functor_.
In this post I want to go through some deeper aspects that characterize functors \[TODO: Add something more\]

`Functor` models the relatively simple concept of _mapping content_, by means of a mapping function `f: A => B`, while preserving the context structure, the context being a generic _type constructor_ `F[_]`.

The functor typeclass is defined in its simplest form as

```scala
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}
```

We know simple types that have a natural implementation of `Functor`, defined by the `map` method already baked in from the standard library:

```scala
implicit val optionFunctor: Functor[Option] = new Functor[Option] {
  def map[A, B](fa: Option[A])(f: A => B): Option[B] = fa map f
}

implicit val listFunctor: Functor[List] = new Functor[List] {
    def map[A, B](fa: List[A])(f: A => B): List[B] = fa map f
}
```

Whenever we have to change the content inside a context, relying solely on the source value and on a pure function `f: A => B` that calculates the target value, then all we need is a `Functor`.

For example let's suppose we want to model a Json decoder, assuming we have already a data type that models the Json tree, we can model a decoder through a typeclass:

```scala
trait Decode[A] {
    def decode(json: Json): A
}

implicit val decodeString: Decode[String] {
    def decode(json: Json): String = json match {
        case JString(s) => s
        case _ => throw new RuntimeException("Can't decode a String")
    }
}
```

Now, provided we have a decoder for a String, we are able to produce not only a String, but any type that can be built from that String, e.g.:

```scala
case class UserId(value: String)

implicit val decodeFunctor: Functor[Decode] = new Functor[Decode] {
  def map[A, B](fa: Decode[A])(f: A => B): Decode[B] = new Decode[B] {
    def decode(json: Json): B = fa.decode(json) andThen f
  } 
}
```
